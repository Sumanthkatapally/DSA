Well‑structured notes you can write/study for the **Rotate Array** problem (LeetCode 189 style) and the specific *triple‑reverse* solution you implemented.

---

### 1. Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps (i.e., every element moves to index `(i + k) % n`). Rotation is in‑place (no extra significant memory).

**Example**
`nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3  -->  [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`
`nums = [1,2,3], k = 4 (4 % 3 = 1) --> [3,1,2]`

---

### 2. Key Observations

* Rotating right by `k` where `k >= n` is same as `k % n`.
* Right rotation by `k` is equivalent to:

  * Taking last `k` elements and moving them to the front.
* In‑place requirement pushes us toward **reverse** or **cyclic replacement** methods instead of using an auxiliary array.

---

### 3. Triple-Reverse Technique (Your Code)

**Idea:**
To right-rotate by `k`, split the array into two parts and reverse them strategically.

Steps for array `A` of length `n`:

1. Normalize: `k = k % n`.
2. Reverse the *left* part (first `n - k` elements).
3. Reverse the *right* part (last `k` elements).
4. Reverse the entire array.

**Why It Works (Intuition):**
Let original array be `L R` where

* `L = A[0 .. n-k-1]`
* `R = A[n-k .. n-1]`

Goal result: `R L`

Reversing `L` → `L^R`, reversing `R` → `R^R`.
Now the array is `L^R R^R`. Reversing whole thing flips order and restores internal order: `(L^R R^R)^R = R L`.

---

### 4. Walkthrough Example

`nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k=3`

* `n=7`, `k=3` → `n-k=4`

1. Reverse `0..3`: `[4,3,2,1,5,6,7]`
2. Reverse `4..6`: `[4,3,2,1,7,6,5]`
3. Reverse whole `0..6`: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`

---

### 5. Correctness Edge Cases

* `k = 0` → no change (step still safe).
* `k % n = 0` (e.g., `k = n, 2n`) → first reverse `0..n-1` then reverse empty subarray second step, then reverse whole → returns to original.
* `n = 1` → trivial (reverses are no-ops).
* Large `k` (e.g., `k = 10^9`) handled via modulo.

---

### 6. Time & Space Complexity

* Each reverse is `O(n)`; three reversals → `O(n)` total.
* Extra space: `O(1)` (in‑place swaps).

---

### 7. Helper Function: `reverseArray`

* Standard two‑pointer swap from both ends moving inward.
* Runs in linear time proportional to segment length.

### 8. Alternative Approaches (For Interview Discussion)

| Approach              | Idea                                          | Time | Space | Notes                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Extra Array           | Place `res[(i+k)%n] = nums[i]` then copy back | O(n) | O(n)  | Simplest but not in‑place                  |
| Cyclic Replacements   | Follow index cycles until all elements moved  | O(n) | O(1)  | Tricky: need to track visited count        |
| Reversal (yours)      | 3 reversals                                   | O(n) | O(1)  | Clean, easy to reason                      |
| Block Swap / Juggling | GCD-based rotation logic                      | O(n) | O(1)  | More common for left rotation explanations |

### 9. Explaining Choice to Interviewer

“I used the triple‑reverse method because it’s **in‑place**, linear time, and simpler to implement correctly than cyclic replacement (which can introduce bugs with cycle counting). It also clearly shows intent: rearrange segments by reversing them.”

---

### 10. Common Pitfalls

* Forgetting `k = k % n` → index errors or redundant work.
* Off‑by‑one on subarray boundaries (`n-k` vs `n-k-1`).
* Using left rotation logic by mistake.
* Not handling `k = 0` or `k = n`— though current code already does.

---

### 11. Variations to Practice

* **Left rotation** by `k`: reverse first `k`, reverse rest, reverse all.
* **Rotate string** (same logic on char array).
* **Rotate linked list** (requires length traversal and tail reconnection).
* **In-place matrix rotation** (different problem—layer by layer).

### 12. Quick Template (Memory Aid)

```
k %= n
reverse(0, n-k-1)
reverse(n-k, n-1)
reverse(0, n-1)
```

---

### 13. Key Takeaway Sentence

“Normalize k, reverse each segment, then reverse whole array to achieve an in-place right rotation in O(n) time and O(1) extra space.”
